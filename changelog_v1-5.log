## Changes:
- Copper Weapons & Copper Horse Armor now use the Copper variant as base item
- added Descendants (NPC Entities):
    - Descendants are passive
    - can't be bred
    - can be bartered with by throwing a Lapis Lazuli item (similar to Piglins)
    - holding a Lapis Lazuli item makes the nearest Descendant follow the player holding the item
    - spawn in Descendant Villages when it's generating
