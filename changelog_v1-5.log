## Changes:
- added new Enchanted Scroll enchantment: Decoy
- Targeting an entity through a spyglass as a Scout now shoots a splash potion (Glow/Slow effect) instead of using a Raycast to detect which entity to affect. This should increase performance on lower end hardware.
- Copper Weapons & Copper Horse Armor now use the Copper variant as base item
- added Descendants (NPC Entities):
    - Descendants are passive
    - can't be bred
    - can be bartered with by throwing a Lapis Lazuli item (similar to Piglins)
    - holding a Lapis Lazuli item makes the nearest Descendant follow the player holding the item
    - spawn in Shelter Structures when it's generating
- Added new Journals:
    - Title: New Horizons
    - 5 Books per Race
- Orebringer Shelter now has Copper Lanterns instead of normal ones
- Loot Tables of Shelter & Outpost structures now contain Lapis Lazuli instead of Emeralds and also have a chance for the new Journals
