  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.moonshroud.15": "A soft silver mist clings to the trees. We stepped into it together, hand in hand. If this is how it ends, then let it be gently.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.1": "The flames no longer comfort. Our great forge flickers low, a mockery of what once roared with purpose. I stood at the gates today, staring out into the obsidian fields. No caravans returned. Only silence. Only ash.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.2": "Lava veins once pulsed beneath our halls, feeding our hearths and hearts alike. Now they sputter, cold and choked. The smiths have gone quiet. Some weep. Some wander. None forge.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.3": "A scout returned, his armor scorched and eyes empty. He spoke of crumbling bastions and warped stone, of once-familiar ground now twisted by unseen forces. We are being unmade.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.4": "The magma channels have reversed. Streams once loyal to gravity now drip upward, defying rule and reason. We sealed the lower tunnels, but too late. Something stirred beneath.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.5": "We tried to invoke the old rites—chants once used to calm the volatile flows—but the echoes mocked us. The obsidian statues cracked, and the fire responded not with warmth, but hunger.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.6": "The blackstone walls bleed with glowing cracks. We speak in whispers now, afraid our voices might shatter what remains. I have sent word to the Ember Priests. No answer.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.7": "A quake struck without warning. The central kiln collapsed. Those inside... I do not write their names. Fire is no longer sacred. It is a predator, and we are prey.",

  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.9": "Even the ghasts flee our skies. Their wails no longer echo above the lava seas. I saw one fall silent mid-flight, its body stiff as glass. What force could silence them?",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.10": "Today, the great chains snapped. The Citadel's floating spires sank into the lava, dragged like anchors by invisible hands. I cannot tell if this is death or rebirth. Only that it is final.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.11": "The magma rivers run cold. I touched one, expecting to burn—but it was like stone. The heat that defined us has abandoned us. Without flame, what are we?",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.12": "We once mined the crimson roots for fuel and food. Now they wither as we touch them. The bastions are silent. I walked their halls today—only my footsteps remain.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.13": "A lone Strider wandered into the city. Its skin was pale, its body stiff. It made no sound, only walked until it crumbled to dust at the central anvil. We dared not touch the remains.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.14": "I held vigil with the Emberguard tonight. We sat beside the shattered core of our forge, surrounded by relics now meaningless. None of us spoke. We only waited, for something we could not name.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.netherian.15": "I sealed the Vault today. Inside are our blueprints, our stonesongs, our sigils—everything we were. If anything finds this place, may they remember us not for our fall, but our fire.",

  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.oakhearted.7": "Tonight, the stars hid behind thick clouds. The forest's silence was a deafening drum in my chest. We light no fires anymore; the woods might burn with sorrow.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.oakhearted.8": "The wildlife hides deeper each day. I glimpsed a doe with hollow eyes, her spirit as broken as the land we walk. The earth weeps beneath our feet.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.oakhearted.9": "Our oldest trees are breaking apart. It feels like the world itself mourns our fall. I wonder if the forest remembers the laughter of our children.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.oakhearted.10": "The hollow ring of falling acorns is our new silence. Our voices fade with the wind, lost among the ancient trunks. I fear no new spring will follow this winter.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.oakhearted.11": "The forest's breath grows faint. I saw a leaf fall, pale and dry, before it even touched the earth. The end feels near, like a slow winter wrapping around our roots.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.oakhearted.12": "The whispers of the forest have turned to mournful silence. Even the wind seems to mourn with us, carrying the scent of forgotten springs and lost hopes.",
  "written_book.fabled_roots.final_days.oakhearted.13": "The roots beneath us tremble, as if the earth itself weeps. Our connection to the land feels fragile, like a thread about to snap. I clutch the last acorn in my hand.",
